-- Question 1  Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you would normalize it to achieve 1NF.
-- Answer 1. The actor_award table in the Sakila database is the table that violate First Normal Form (1NF).
--           Here, the awards column violates 1NF because it contains multiple values (multiple awards) in a single field.
--           To make this table conform to First Normal Form (1NF), each award should be stored as an atomic value. 
--           That means there should be no multi-valued attributes in a single column.



-- Question 2 Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. If it violates 2NF. 
-- explain the steps to normalize it?
-- Answer 2. The film table from sakila databse violates 2NF. 
--           The special_features column contains multiple values (e.g., "Behind the Scenes, Commentary").
--           This violates 1NF because the values in this column are not atomicâ€”they contain a list of features instead of one feature per field.
--           2NF requires the table to be in 1NF, and since special_features violates 1NF, the table automatically violates 2NF.
--           To bring the film table into 2NF, we need to address both the 1NF violation & partial dependencies.
--           We should create a new table, that stores one special feature per row, establishing a relationship between film_id and special_features.
--           After fixing the 1NF violation, we also need to ensure there are no partial dependencies in the table.
--           We need to create a new table for the special_features and link it to the film table by creating foreign key relationships.



-- Question 3. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF Describe the transitive dependencies present and outline the steps to normalize the table to 3NF.
-- Answer 3.  A table is in 3NF if: It is in 2NF. And no transitive dependencies exist, i.e., non-prime attributes should not depend on anything other than the primary key.
--            The customer table violates 3rd Normal Form (3NF)  in the Sakila database. 
--            In the customer table, there is a transitive dependency through the address_id:
--            The address_id determines the customer's city and country. This is a transitive dependency because address_id is dependent on customer_id, 
--            but city and country are dependent on address_id (not customer_id directly).

--            Steps to Normalize the customer Table to 3NF:

--            1. Analyse the violation 
--            2. Create new table to store data 
--            3. Update customer table (make store id as foreign key)
--            4. Update address info. (so it reference to the foreign key)



-- Question 4. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing it from the initial unnormalized form up to at least 2NF.
-- Answer 4. 
--             The film table in this database appears unnormalized. To normalize it up to 2NF, follow these steps:
--             Primary Key: Use film_id as the primary key.
--             Eliminate Repeating Groups: The special_features column violates 1NF with multiple values. Create a separate table for special features.
--             Eliminate Partial Dependencies: Attributes like language_id and original_language_id are partially dependent on film_id. Create a new table for languages and reference it via foreign keys.
--             Check for Transitive Dependencies: No transitive dependencies are present, so the table is now in 2NF.
